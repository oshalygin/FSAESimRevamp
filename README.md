##Major overhaul to FSAESim:

The primary driver behind the overhaul was to give a better user experience for global teams.  With the inclusion of a better UI and backend, we can enable teams to persist changes, view history and seamlessly navigate throughout the application.  This overhaul also involves a maintainable platform moving forward which will be extended by future collaboration.

###The following technology is used in this application
* NodeJs
* Express
* MongoDb
* Mongoose
* React
* Redux
* Material Design
* Sinon
* Enzyme
* Mocha
* WebPack
* Babel
* ESLint


Developed by Oleg Shalygin, primarily to make the web a better place.
